#Precompute lower and upper bound 

we precompute lower and upper bound of given time-dependent graph for all {source, destination} pair before running bidirectional search alogrithm.

this code generate new large txt file (aprrox. 9GB ), whose size depends on input dataset available in "../graphs/" directory contains all. 


main.cpp: a driver code for lower and upper bound computation.

#compile:
	type in console:
	make

#run:
	./bound
